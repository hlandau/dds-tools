ddstools - tools for converting AS/400 QDDSSRC files.

ddstools is distributed under the GNU General Public License.
Please see the file COPYING for license terms.

ddstools consists of two programs: dds2sql and dds2curses.

dds2sql converts QDDSSRC source files for describing externally
described files to an SQL table definition.  I use MySQL so I
know it works for that.  Once the table is created you can run:

mysql < outputfile

where outputfile is the file created by dds2sql.

dds2curses takes a QDDSSRC display file definition and converts
it to C code suitable for the ncurses library.  The resulting
code can then be used in C programs to create screens.

To build ddstools you must have installed:

 - ncurses (curses will probably also work)

Actually you don't.  You only need ncurses to use dds2curses
output in your programs.  If you don't need this then you are set.
Then review the Makefile to be sure everything looks right.
Then type 'make'.  Everything should build with no errors.

To use dds2sql and dds2curses you first need to get the DDS source
member from the AS/400.  I use FTP on the AS/400 to do this.  Start
FTP on the AS/400 and connect to the host you want to run the
conversions on.  Then send the appropriate DDS source member:

put <library>/QDDSSRC.<member> <name>

where <library> is the library that your source file is in and
<member> is the member you want to send.  You don't have to specify
<name> if you don't want - it just allows you to name the file
on the receiving host (other than the default - qddssrc.<member>).

Once you have the source files on your UNIX host you can run dds2sql:

$ dds2sql <inputfile> <outputfile>

where <inputfile> is the name of the DDS source member you sent (<name>
if you specified it) and <outputfile> is the name you want to use for
the SQL table name.

Run dds2curses:

$ dds2curses <inputfile> <outputfile>

where <inputfile> is the name of the DDS source member you sent (<name>
if you specified it) and <outputfile> is the name of the file to store
the curses C code (maybe something like screens.c).
